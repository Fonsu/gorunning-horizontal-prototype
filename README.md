Minimal horizontal prototype for the use case of a social running mobile first app

## Horizontal prototype

A common term for a user interface prototype is the horizontal prototype. It provides a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction more than low-level system functionality, such as database access. Horizontal prototypes are useful for:
* Confirmation of user interface requirements and system scope,
* Demonstration version of the system to obtain buy-in from the business,
* Develop preliminary estimates of development time, cost and effort.
